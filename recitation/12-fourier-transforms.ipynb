This will add a visual element to help better understand the mathematics behind these transforms. In addition, discussion will be made on a real-life situation where FFT can be used to aid object classification.\n",

In cases where cartesian coordinates are not necessary suitable for describing spectra, for example, we can use fourier transforms to plot the important frequencies. Let's do a few fourier transforms so you get comfortable with the graphical relationships.\n",

    "Here, we are going to cover the Convolution Theorem, which states that the pointwise product of two Fourier Transforms is equivalent to the convolution of two Inverse Fourier Transforms. Here, the pointwise product is just a product, but in some algebraic concepts can mean something much more complicated. The convolution on the other hand consideres shape formed from the overlap of two distinct graphs. What the Convolution Theorem does is allow for analyzing graphs that can't be expressed explicitly by a single form.\n",

    "3. What two functions could you postulate make up this function? This step is known as convolution because we are working with one function that is actually a combination of two.\n",
