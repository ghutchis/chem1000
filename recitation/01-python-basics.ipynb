    "\n",
    "We can use any set of letters, numbers and underscores to make variable names however a variable name *cannot* begin with a number. There are many different kinds of naming conventions and we refer to the [Style Guide for Python Code (PEP8)](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#naming-conventions) for a summary.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, in Python, people use `lower_case_with_underscores` variable names and single lowercase letter variable names such as `x`. It is good practice to use descriptive variable names, like `height_in_meters` to make your code more readable for other people (including yourself looking back later).\n",
    "\n",
    "However there are words that we should not use as variable names because these words already have special meaning in Python, including [reserved words](https://docs.python.org/3.3/reference/lexical_analysis.html#keywords) and built-in functions For example, do not use `class`, `import`, `sum`, `min`, `max`, `list` or `sorted` as a variable name. See the full list of [builtin functions](https://docs.python.org/3/library/functions.html). Generally if you either use single letters or descriptive `words_with_underscores` you should be fine."
