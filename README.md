Course materials, lecture notes, homework, etc.

**Overview:** How does one calculate the concentration of chemical reactants and products as a function of time? How does Fourier transform spectroscopy work? Where do molecular orbitals come from? Mathematical tools are essential across chemistry. In this class, we will survey the most important mathematical methods for chemists and illustrate applications to problems from across the chemical field.

**Learning Objectives:** After finishing the course, students should be able to apply mathematical tools to common problems in physical and analytical chemistry, including solving ordinary and partial differential equations, performing Fourier transforms, calculating differentials, solving integrals, optimizing functions, working with complex numbers, vectors, matrices, and eigenvalues. *Phew,* thatâ€™s a lot. Students should be able to solve basic chemistry-related mathematical problems using the Python programming language and use Jupyter notebooks.
