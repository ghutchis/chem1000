    "I go running almost every day. I use a GPS watch to track my runs. Ideally, I'd want my watch to be both *repeatable* (i.e., I get the same result every time I run the same route) and *true* (i.e., if I run a 5 kilometer race, I want the reading to be 5.0 km, not 4.6 km, or 5.3 km). Incdentally, that's [rarely the case](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/GPS_Accuracy).\n",

    "An additional problem stems from how floating point numbers are usually handled in a computer. A brief detour.. Computers naturally work in binary, so 0.1 is not usually represented in decimal form, but instead in a *binary fraction*. Consider $0.125 = \\frac{1}{8}$ - the denominator is an exact power of two so it can be stored exactly. $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ can too. But 0.1 has to be stored as an [approximation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html). Look what happens if we ask Python for $0.1*3$."
