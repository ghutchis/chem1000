    "### 0.a. Significant Figures\n",
    "\n",
    "Significant figures, or \"sig figs\" are of course ***everyone's*** favorite topic in chemistry courses. ðŸ˜œ\n",
    "\n",
    "To be fair, they are a simplification of general rules for handling errors and uncertainty in measurements and the resulting mathematical treatment. More complete rules are generally part of the general topics:\n",
    "- [error propagation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Propagation_of_uncertainty)\n",
    "- [uncertainty quantification](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uncertainty_quantification)\n",
    "- [accuracy and precision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Accuracy_and_precision)\n",
    "\n",
    "To quote from [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significance_arithmetic#Disagreements_about_importance):\n",
    "> Significant figures are used extensively in high school and undergraduate courses as a shorthand for the precision with which a measurement is known. However, significant figures are not a perfect representation of uncertainty, and are not meant to be. Instead, they are a useful tool for avoiding expressing more information than the experimenter actually knows, and for avoiding rounding numbers in such a way as to lose precision.\n",
    "\n",
    "I go running almost every day. I use a GPS watch to track my runs. Ideally, I'd want my watch to be both *repeatable* (i.e., I get the same result every time I run the same route) and *true* (i.e., if I run a 5 kilometer race, I want the reading to be 5.0 km, not 4.6 km, or 5.3 km). Incdentally, that's [rarely the case](https://fellrnr.com/wiki/GPS_Accuracy).\n",
    "\n",
    "We will come back to these topics again - for now, we'll stick to reviewing general rules of [significant figures for arithmetic](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significance_arithmetic)\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- Exact values (e.g., 2 chairs) are precise and ignored from significant figure tracking.\n",
    "- [Significant figures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Significant_figures) should be tracked from measurements, etc. The last number is an indication of uncertainty. For example, if you use an instrument with 2 cm<sup>-1</sup> resolution, then the measurement should be 1602 cm<sup>-1</sup>, not 1602.45 cm<sup>-1</sup>, even if some computer reports the latter.\n",
    "- When multiplying or dividing, track the smallest number of **significant figures**, which will be used for your answer.\n",
    "  - Example: 2.5 * 1.05 = 2.6, not 2.625\n",
    "- When adding or subtracting, track the smallest number of **decimal places** (i.e., the least precise number). You will often lose significant figures when subtracting.\n",
    "  - Example: 1 gram + 1.1 gram = 2. grams, not 2.1 gram\n",

    "- When taking an exponent ($10^x$ or $e^x$) the answer should have as many significant figures as the number of decimals: $e^{23.780} = 6.02\\times 10^{23}$"

    "An additional problem stems from how floating point numbers are usually handled in a computer. A brief detour.. Computers naturally work in binary, so 0.1 is not usually represented in decimal form, but instead in a *binary fraction*. Consider $0.125 = \\frac{1}{8}$ - the denominator is an exact power of two so it can be stored exactly. $\\frac{1}{2}$ and $\\frac{1}{4}$ can too. But 0.1 has to be stored as an [approximation](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/floatingpoint.html). Look what happens if we ask Python for $0.1*3$."
