    "An integral in one dimension computes the area under a curve. If we take an integral over \"everything,\" it's equivalent to adding up all the area.\n",

    "For example, the [Maxwell-Boltzmann distribution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maxwell%E2%80%93Boltzmann_distribution) gives the probability of an ideal gas molecule moving at various velocities as a function of the mass of the molecule and the temperature.\n",

    "In quantum mechanics, wavefunctions $\\psi$ have no known meaning - they could be complex numbers. On the other hand, the product $\\psi^* \\psi$ should represent the probability, e.g. of finding an electron at a particular point or region of space.\n",
