    "### Scalars vs. Vectors\n",
    "\n",
    "Reminder...\n",
    "\n",
    "**Scalars** are just numbers - they have a magnitude, a size. The mass of a molecule would be an example, e.g., 120 amu.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vectors** have both a magnitude and a direction:\n",
    "- velocity $\\mathbf{v}$\n",
    "- acceleration $\\mathbf{a}$\n",
    "- force $\\mathbf{F}$\n",
    "- electric field $\\mathbf{E}$\n",
    "\n",
    "### Scalar Functions and Vector Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **function** takes in a number, a vector, etc. and returns a number:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\sin 0 = 0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that $\\sin x$ is a scalar function. You give it something, and it returns a **scalar**.\n",
    "\n",
    "By extension, there must be **vector functions** too - one that returns a vector for every point.\n",
    "\n",
    "Right now, you're experiencing force due to gravity. If you stand up, the forces acting on your body change over time. (Consider if you go on a roller coaster or fly in an airplane.)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\overrightarrow{\\boldsymbol{F}}(t)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that time is a scalar - it's just a number. So a vector function returns a vector regardless of what the input is. It might be one-dimensional (e.g., the force we feel at a given time $t$) or 2D or 3D, etc. (e.g., the forces on a satellite in space .. we probably care about the position of the satellite but maybe also time.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vector Fields\n",
    "\n",
    "When we have a vector function in 2D or 3D, we usually call these **vector fields**. \n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "A **vector field** is a function that return a vector for every (x,y) or (x, y, z) point.\n",
    "    \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "It sounds abstract, but we're actually already familiar with the concept. Consider a weather map showing wind:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/wind-vectors.png' width=\"540\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Depending on our location, the wind speed and vector will differ. Let's look at a [tropical cyclone (Hurricane \n",
    "Sally)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tropical_Storm_Sally_(2020)) in the Gulf of Mexico.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/hurricane.png' width=\"505\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously, the further away from the hurricane, the wind speed (magnitude) decreases, and there's an *eye* in the center, where there's no wind at all. Also, the vector direction differs depending on where you are.\n",
    "\n",
    "In chemistry, we encounter a range of vector functions and vector fields. For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The force acting on a charge in an electric field. At each point in space, the force acting on the charge will have a specific magnitude and a direction.\n",
    "- Fluid flow for which each element of the fluid at some point in space has a given speed and direction of flow. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are a few key terms with vector fields:\n",
    "- a **sink** is a point in which all vectors flow inward\n",
    "- a **source** is a point at which all vectors flow outward\n",
    "- a **saddle-point** has no net inward or outward flow (i.e., they balance exactly)\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src='../images/vector-field.png' />\n",
    "\n",
    "(Image from [*Mathematical Methods for Chemists*](http://sites.bu.edu/straub/mathematical-methods-for-molecular-science/)) \n",
    "\n",
    "Here, the red point is a **source** and all the arrows point away from it (imagine the forces from a negative charge towards an electron). \n",
    "\n",
    "The black point is a **sink** and all the arrows point towards it (e.g., a positive charge that will attract an electron).\n",
    "\n",
    "The two \"X\" points are **saddle points**. Notice that they come inward along one direction and outward along another direction. (Think about a horse saddle that rises up to the neck and head and also to the tail, and slopes down along the sides.)"
