    "### Differential Equations - Categories / Naming\n",
    "\n",
    "First off, a [**differential equation**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Differential_equation) is simply some type of mathematical equation that includes some type of derivative of a function.\n",
    "\n",
    "Wikipedia:\n",
    ">In applications, the functions generally represent physical quantities, the derivatives represent their rates of change, and the differential equation defines a relationship between the two. Such relations are common; therefore, differential equations play a prominent role in many disciplines including engineering, physics, chemistry, economics, and biology.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving differential equations generally depends on the *type* of \"diff eq\", so there are some general categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"alert alert-block alert-success\">\n",
    "\n",
    "An **ordinary differential equation** (ODE) only involves one variable and thus ordinary derivatives.\n",
    "    \n",
    "A **partial differential equation** (PDE) includes multiple variables and partial derivatives.\n",
    "    \n",
    "</div>\n",
    "\n",
    "We also categorize differential equations by their **order** defined by the term with the highest derivative:\n",
    "- First derivatives = first-order differential equation\n",
    "- Second derivatives = second-order differential equation\n",
    "- etc.\n",
