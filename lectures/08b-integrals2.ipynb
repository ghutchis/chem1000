    "\n",
    "#### To help pick the \"u\" for integration, there's a priority list [\"LIATE\"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integration_by_parts#LIATE_rule):\n",

    "4. Trigonometric\n",
    "5. Exponential\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, pick a \"u\" term in the list, and the \"dv\" comes later in the list.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Repeated Integration by Parts via Table\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes you need to do repeated integration by parts because the new integral also requires integration by parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int u d v=u v-\\int v d u\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "but the $\\int v d u$ part also requires integration by parts...\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\int x^{3} \\cos x d x\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "The LIATE rules suggest we want to take the $x^3$ as $u$ and the $\\cos x dx$ as $dv$.\n",
