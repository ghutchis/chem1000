    "- It's *free* and through the Jupyter notebook system doesn't require anything to install.\n",
    "  - That means we can run our code on the powerful Pitt clusters, or even Google \"Colab\" - multiple free services exist\n",
    "- It offers many *libraries* of existing code for many, many common science and math tasks, from statistics, curve fitting, processing spectroscopy, quantum chemistry, etc.\n",
    "- It's fairly easy to learn - most scientists are not programmers, nor are paid to do so.\n",
    "- The Jupyter notebooks we use for Python allow you to include documentation / explanation in addition to the math and code.\n",
    "- There's lots of documentation, tutorials, etc. online if you have trouble or want to learn more.\n",
