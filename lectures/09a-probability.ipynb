    "\n",
    "A common technique in simulating chemistry and physical behavior is called [Monte Carlo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method) - essentially using random processes to solve complicated problems. For example, one can randomly sample many possible shapes of a polymer or sample from multiple possible arrangements in a nanoparticle, etc.\n",

    "\n",
    "We're generally familiar with *descrete* random numbers, like flipping a coin heads or tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we flip a coin once, it's 1/2 chance of heads or tails.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over multiple events - each one is independent - the probability of a particular number of heads (n) in a total of N flips is:\n",

    "### Multinomial Probability\n",

    "\n",
    "That's a cumulative probability - he doesn't care *which* gift gives him the dragon, only that one of the thirty gifts works.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here's the catch - the game only gives dragons with 1% chance - you're more likely to get other prizes.\n",
    "\n",
    "While there's a formula, it's really, really easy to compute this with a for() loop.\n",
    "- what's the total cumulative chance?\n",
    "- what's the chance we didn't get the prize on the last round\n",
    "\n",
    "e.g.\n",
    "- first time through, there's a 1% chance of a win\n",
    "- second time, there was a 99% chance we didn't win, times the 1% chance I win on this round = 0.99% chance on this gift\n",

    "### Moments from Distributions\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes people will discuss \"[*moments*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_(mathematics))\" of probability distributions or statistical distributions.\n",
    "\n",
    "These are related to the shape of the distribution.\n",
    "- the \"zeroth\" moment is the total (e.g., for a probability it should be 1 = 100%)\n",
    "- first moment is the [mean](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) $\\mu$ (i.e., the center or \"expected value\")\n",
    "- second moment is the [variance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Variance) $\\sigma^2$ (i.e., the width)\n",
    "    - you're probably more familiar with the standard deviation $\\sigma$\n",
    "- third moment is the [skewness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skewness) (i.e., the asymmetry of the distribution)\n",
    "- fourth moment, the [kurtosis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurtosis) (i.e., how thin or thick the \"tail\" of the distribution)\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, the mean, variance (or standard deviation which is the square root of the variance) and the skewness are the most useful measures of a distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Skewness\n",
    "\n",
    "Not all distributions are \"normal\" or symmetric. For example, the number of people waiting for a bus is never negative. Even if I tell you the average is 5 people in the morning, sometimes it's zero (when the bus just arrived) and it's sometimes much higher (right before the bus comes and someone runs to catch it).\n",
