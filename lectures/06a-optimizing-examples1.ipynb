    "### Quick Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In chemistry and physics, we often want to determine the maximum or minimum value of a function of one or many variables. Examples include characterizing the minima, maxima, and saddle points on a potential energy surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Optimizing functions in one dimension is pretty easy, if sometimes tedious.\n",
    "1. Take derivatives and find where the first derivative is zero\n",
    "2. Look at the second derivatives, to categorize as a minima / maxima / inflection point\n",
    "3. Then compare values of the function at those points to see if it's a local minima / max or the global minima / max.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Many Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Not surprisingly, we can use a similar technique in multiple dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a function $f(x,y)$ in two dimensions, then to have an extrema:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}=0 \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}=0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we need to see the partial derivative with respect to **both / all** variables be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then categorize the type of minima / maxima with the [Hessian]. (Later, we will see that this is the *determinant* of the Hessian matrix, for when we have more than 2 variables.)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D=\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial y^{2}}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial y \\partial x}\\right)\n",
