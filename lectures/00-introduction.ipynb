    "Yes, physicists like to think that chemistry is just \"applied physics\" and mathematics like to think everything is just \"applied math.\" Which means, we want to focus on some key concepts beyond algebra and calculus that have important chemical applications, particularly in physical and analytical chemistry:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does one calculate the concentration of chemical reactants and products as a function of time?\n",
    "- Where do molecular orbitals get their shape? \n",
    "- How does Fourier transform spectroscopy work?\n",
    "- How do we track errors and uncertainty through calculations?\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is that traditional math classes are *abstract* but in chemistry, our needs are concrete. Thus, our aim in the class is to learn the key skills needed -- and to see how these techniques can be applied to interesting applications."

    "I will be using the [Python programming language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_(programming_language)) in class, pretty much every lecture. We'll use [Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/), which is a nice way to run Python notebooks in a web browser. The actual work will be done by [Pitt's Center for Research Computing](https://crc.pitt.edu/).\n",

    "\n",
    "**Why? Isn't this a chemistry course?**\n",
    "\n",
    "Learning Python will let us [automate the boring stuff](https://automatetheboringstuff.com/). Python is a modern programming language that's fairly easy to learn and used widely in scientific computation (especially chemistry). It has a large number of \"modules\" specifically designed for scientific and mathematical applications, which make it easy to perform calculations and visualize data that would be difficult or time-consuming to do by hand.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/AutomateBoring.png\" width=\"400\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, some equations are impossible to solve using algebra and calculus, so we need [numerical methods](https://en.wikipedia.org//wiki/Numerical_analysis) and literally crunch numbers. If you ever did examples of derivatives using approximations, or used the area to approximate an integral, you used numeric methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a user-friendly language that is easy to learn and use, making it a good choice for students who are new to programming. It has a large and active community of users, so it is easy to find resources and support when you need help.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Most importantly, Python does everything we need. It will help us do math, plot functions and data, solve differential equations, analyze, visualize scientific data, etc.\n",
    "- It's ***free*** and open source, so you don't need to pay for a license to use it.\n",
    "- Through the Jupyter notebook system doesn't require anything to install - you can use this through any recent web browser.\n",
    "  - You can use a laptop or an iPad or tablet. (I haven't tried on a phone, but probably?)\n",
    "  - We can run our code on the powerful [Pitt clusters](https://hub.crc.pitt.edu/), [Google \"Colab\"](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), or [Microsoft Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com/) - multiple free and paid services exist. If you want to run offline, you can install Python 3.x from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).\n",
    "- It's one of the most widely used languages in STEM (and [outside of STEM too](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)…)\n",
    "- It's fairly easy to learn - most scientists are not programmers, nor are paid to do so.\n",
    "  - There's lots of documentation, tutorials, etc. online if you have trouble or want to learn more.\n",
    "- It offers many free, open source *libraries* of existing code for many, many common science and math tasks, from [statistics](https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/), [curve fitting](https://education.molssi.org/python-data-analysis/03-data-fitting/index.html), [processing spectroscopy](https://www.nmrglue.com/), [quantum chemistry](https://psicode.org/), [machine learning](http://scikit-learn.org/), etc.\n",
    "- The Jupyter notebooks we use for Python allow you to include documentation / explanation and graphics, in addition to the math and code.\n",
    "- Python is widely used in industry, academia, and government labs, making it a valuable skill for your resumé. Many employers now look for candidates with programming skills, so having experience in Python can make you a more competitive candidate.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course does not assume any programming experience, let alone with Python. No problem. You do not need to become an expert to do well in the class - this is not a CS or programming class, it's a chemistry class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal though, is to have the computer do some work, so we (the humans) can focus on the *concepts* instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are **not required** to use Python - you can do all homework with pencil and paper, Wolfram Alpha, MATLAB, etc. if you're more comfortable. Based on my experience you'll find it easier and faster to use these noteboooks. It's 2025, and computers can help you do math and chemistry. In my experience, a bit of work writing code is usually repaid many times in making chemistry analysis easier and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider this an experiment - I hope you'll have an open mind and we'll have some surveys throughout the class to see what you think about Python and Jupyter."
