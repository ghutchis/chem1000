    "Yes, physicists like to think that chemistry is just \"applied physics\" and mathematics like to think everything is just \"applied math.\" Which means, we want to focus on some key concepts beyond algebra and calculus that have important chemical applications, particularly in physical and analytical chemistry:\n",
    "\n",
    "- How does one calculate the concentration of chemical reactants and products as a function of time?\n",
    "- Where do molecular orbitals get their shape? \n",
    "- How does Fourier transform spectroscopy work?\n",
    "- How do we track errors and uncertainty through calculations?\n",
    "\n",
    "The challenge is that traditional math classes are *abstract* but in chemistry, our needs are concrete. Thus, our aim in the class is to learn the key skills needed -- and to see how these techniques can be applied to interesting applications."

    "### Python / Jupyter\n",
    "\n",
    "I will be using the Python programming language in class, pretty much every lecture. We'll use Jupyter, which is a nice way to run Python notebooks in a web browser.\n",
    "\n",
    "Why?\n",
    "\n",
    "- It's one of the most widely used languages in STEM (and [outside of STEM too](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/)…)\n",
    "- It's open source and ***free*** and through the Jupyter notebook system doesn't require anything to install - you can use this through any recent web browser.\n",
    "  - That means we can run our code on the powerful Pitt clusters, [Google \"Colab\"](https://colab.research.google.com/), [Binder](https://mybinder.org/), or [Microsoft Azure](https://notebooks.azure.com/) - multiple free and paid services exist. If you want to run offline, you can install Python 3.x from [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).\n",
    "- It offers many free, open source *libraries* of existing code for many, many common science and math tasks, from [statistics](https://www.statsmodels.org/devel/), curve fitting, processing spectroscopy, quantum chemistry, [machine learning](http://scikit-learn.org/), etc.\n",
    "- It's fairly easy to learn - most scientists are not programmers, nor are paid to do so.\n",
    "  - There's lots of documentation, tutorials, etc. online if you have trouble or want to learn more.\n",
    "- The Jupyter notebooks we use for Python allow you to include documentation / explanation in addition to the math and code.\n",
    "\n",
    "This course does not assume any programming experience, let alone with Python. No problem. You do not need to become an expert to do well in the class - this is not a CS or programming class, it's a chemistry class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal though, is to have the computer do some work, so we (the humans) can focus on the *concepts* instead. \n",
    "\n",
    "You are **not required** to use Python - you can do all homework with pencil and paper, Wolfram Alpha, MATLAB, etc. if you're more comfortable. Based on my experience you'll find it easier and faster to use these noteboooks. It's 2020, and computers can help you do math and chemistry. In my experience, a bit of work writing code is usually repaid many times in making chemistry analysis easier and faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's consider this an experiment - I hope you'll have an open mind and we'll have some surveys throughout the class to see what you think about Python and Jupyter."
