    "### Why\n",
    "\n",
    "In chemistry and physics, we often want to determine the maximum or minimum value of a function of one or many variables. Examples include characterizing the minima, maxima, and saddle points on a potential energy surface.\n",
    "\n",
    "Remember from Calculus, that at a maximum or a minimum, the derivative must be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/extrema.png\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide on the type of extrema, we look at the derivative:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left.\\frac{d^{2} f(x)}{d x^{2}}\\right|_{x=x^{*}}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "<0, & \\text { maximum } \\\\\n",
    "=0, & \\text { inflection point } \\\\\n",
    ">0, & \\text { minimum }\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, the second derivative is negative at a maxima because it \"points down.\" At a minima, the second derivative is positive and \"points up.\" At an inflection point, the derivative isn't zero, but the second derivative is, because on one side it is positive and on the other side it is negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, optimizing functions in one dimension is pretty easy, if sometimes tedious.\n",
    "1. Take derivatives and find where the first derivative is zero\n",
    "2. Look at the second derivatives, to categorize as a minima / maxima / inflection point\n",
    "3. Then compare values of the function at those points to see if it's a local minima / max or the global minima / max.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Many Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "Not surprisingly, we can use a similar technique in multiple dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we have a function $f(x,y)$ in two dimensions, then to have an extrema:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial x}=0 \\quad \\frac{\\partial f}{\\partial y}=0\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, we need to see the partial derivative with respect to **both / all** variables be zero.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can then categorize the type of minima / maxima with the [Hessian]. (Later, we will see that this is the *determinant* of the Hessian matrix, for when we have more than 2 variables.)\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "D=\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial y^{2}}\\right)-\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x \\partial y}\\right)\\left(\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial y \\partial x}\\right)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\left.\\frac{\\partial^{2} f}{\\partial x^{2}}\\right|_{\\left(x^{*}, y^{*}\\right)}=\\left\\{\\begin{array}{ll}\n",
    "<0 & D>0 & \\text { maximum } \\\\\n",
    ">0 & D>0 & \\text { minimum } \\\\\n",
    " & D < 0 & \\text { saddle-point }\n",
    "\\end{array}\\right.\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",

    "### More Complicated Functions\n",
    "\n",
    "Sometimes in chemistry, functions are complicated enough that we can't easily find all the zeros.\n",
    "\n",
    "When?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's imagine I want to optimize the geometry of a molecule. Each atom can move independently of the other atoms, so that's:\n",
    "- X, Y, and Z displacement for atom 1\n",
    "- X, Y, and Z displacement for atom 2\n",
    "- .. etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "So for N atoms, that's 3 displacements per atom, or 3N. To be precise, I'll need to subtract out cases where I move all the atoms the same amount in the X, Y, or Z directions - that's just moving the whole molecule. And I'll need to subtract our cases where I rotate the whole molecule along the X, Y, or Z axis.. so generally I have 3N-6 variabels to optimize. For water, that's 3 variables, but even for ethane, that's 8 atoms and 18 variables to optimize at once.\n",
    "\n",
    "How do we optimize ethane or something more complicated?\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"../images/atom-forces.png\" width=\"341\" />\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we can presumably calculate the potential energy as a function of the atom positions, we calculate:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "V(1, 2, 3 .. 8)\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Then we calculate the gradients on each atom:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\boldsymbol{F} = -\\boldsymbol{\\nabla} V\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "We push the atoms a little bit, and repeat. How much do we push the atoms? There are a few methods:\n",
    "- [steepest gradient descent](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent)\n",
    "- [conjugate gradient](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conjugate_gradient_method)\n",
    "- [BFGS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broyden%E2%80%93Fletcher%E2%80%93Goldfarb%E2%80%93Shanno_algorithm) or limited-memory L-BFGS\n",
    "\n",
    "In some sense these are all methods that determine how much you should move along the gradient, and then what should you do .. to eventually end up at the extrema. (You pick whether you're going uphill or downhill to Point State Park.)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Example: \n",
    "\n",
